/**
 * Interface used for serialization of {@link Operation} execution.
 *
 * Native Android BLE API is asynchronous but does not queue operations on it's own. Operations like scanning, connecting, reading, writing
 * in order to be successfully started need to be serialized at different levels.
 * <br>
 * i.e. When dealing with a {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothGatt} each read and write needs to be synchronized but changing connection
 * priority does not.
 * <br>
 * i.e.2 When starting to connect the {@link android.bluetooth.BluetoothGatt} the Android Stack does queue direct connections internally
 * but due to a bug the callback may not be called â€” serializing connection establishment does allow for proper timeout management in this
 * case
